| Points per Hour | Team productivity | Current velocity |

## ðŸ”§ Common Tasks

### Updating Team Hours

When someone's schedule changes:

1. Admin â†’ Team Management
2. Edit the team member
3. Update their hours
4. Future sprints will use new hours

### Handling Part-Time Team Members

1. Set Total Gross Hours to their actual hours (e.g., 20 for half-time)
2. Adjust Meeting Hours proportionally
3. Net Hours will calculate correctly

### Managing On-Call Rotations

1. Update team member's On-Call Hours when they're on rotation
2. Reduce to 0 when rotation ends
3. Sprint capacity adjusts automatically

### Sprint Planning with Forecasting

1. Check Dashboard â†’ Forecasted Capacity
2. Use predicted points as starting point
3. Adjust based on team changes or priorities
4. Create sprint with planned points

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices

### Data Entry

- âœ… Be consistent with story point estimation
- âœ… Update sprint data promptly after sprint ends
- âœ… Keep team member hours current
- âœ… Use descriptive sprint names

### Team Setup

- âœ… Include all team members who contribute to sprints
- âœ… Account for meetings, on-call, and time off realistically
- âœ… Update hours when schedules change
- âœ… Use actual working hours, not contracted hours

### Sprint Tracking

- âœ… Track carry-over work separately
- âœ… Record unplanned work that gets added
- âœ… Be honest about completion rates
- âœ… Include all work that contributes to velocity

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No Sprint Data Available"**

- Create your first sprint in Admin section

**Velocity seems too high/low**

- Check team working hours are realistic
- Verify story point scale is consistent
- Ensure carry-over points are tracked correctly

**Forecasting shows "Insufficient Data"**

- Need at least 2-3 sprints for predictions
- Create more sprints to improve accuracy

**Team member shows 0 net hours**

- Check that deductions (on-call + meetings + time off) don't exceed gross hours
- Adjust hours to be realistic

**Dashboard metrics not updating**

- Refresh the page
- Check that sprint data was saved correctly
- Verify team member data is current

### Validation Errors

**"Sprint name is required"**

- Enter a descriptive name for the sprint

**"Points cannot be negative"**

- Ensure all point values are 0 or positive

**"Carry over completed cannot exceed carry over total"**

- Completed carry-over points must be â‰¤ total carry-over points

**"At least one team member must be selected"**

- Add team members before creating sprints
