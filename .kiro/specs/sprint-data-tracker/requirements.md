# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a local web application for tracking and analyzing sprint data to replace the current spreadsheet-based approach. The application will be built using a JavaScript framework (Next.js or Astro) and run locally without requiring deployment. It will provide an admin interface for data entry and a dashboard for viewing sprint metrics and forecasts. Data will be stored locally using a simple, portable format (JSON or SQLite) to ensure zero cost and easy portability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a sprint manager, I want to enter sprint data through an admin interface, so that I can easily record all relevant sprint metrics when starting a new sprint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the admin page THEN the system SHALL display a form for entering sprint data
2. WHEN I enter planned points THEN the system SHALL accept and validate the numeric input
3. WHEN I enter carry over points THEN the system SHALL accept and validate the numeric input
4. WHEN I enter carry over points already completed THEN the system SHALL accept and validate the numeric input
5. WHEN I enter forecasted capacity THEN the system SHALL accept and validate the numeric input
6. WHEN I enter points completed THEN the system SHALL accept and validate the numeric input
7. WHEN I enter number of working hours THEN the system SHALL accept and validate the numeric input
8. WHEN I submit the sprint data form THEN the system SHALL save the data to local storage
9. WHEN I submit invalid data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a sprint manager, I want to view sprint metrics on a dashboard, so that I can analyze team performance and make data-driven decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current sprint metrics
2. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show average velocity over a configurable time period
3. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display forecasted capacity for the next sprint
4. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show historical sprint data in a readable format
5. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN the system SHALL calculate and display velocity trends
6. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show capacity utilization metrics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a sprint manager, I want the system to automatically calculate forecasted capacity based on historical velocity, so that I can plan future sprints more accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system calculates forecasted capacity THEN it SHALL use velocity data from the last X sprints (configurable)
2. WHEN there is insufficient historical data THEN the system SHALL display a warning message
3. WHEN velocity data is available THEN the system SHALL calculate the average velocity
4. WHEN forecasted capacity is calculated THEN the system SHALL display the calculation methodology
5. WHEN I configure the number of sprints for forecasting THEN the system SHALL update calculations accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a sprint manager, I want data to be stored in a simple, portable format, so that I can easily backup, migrate, or share the data without vendor lock-in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is saved THEN the system SHALL store it in either JSON or SQLite format
2. WHEN I need to backup data THEN the system SHALL allow easy access to the data files
3. WHEN I move the application THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically load existing data
5. IF no data exists THEN the system SHALL initialize with empty datasets

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a sprint manager, I want to view and edit historical sprint data, so that I can correct mistakes or update incomplete information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the admin page THEN the system SHALL display a list of previous sprints
2. WHEN I select a previous sprint THEN the system SHALL load that sprint's data for editing
3. WHEN I modify historical data THEN the system SHALL update the stored data
4. WHEN I modify historical data THEN the system SHALL recalculate dependent metrics
5. WHEN I delete a sprint THEN the system SHALL confirm the action before proceeding

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a sprint manager, I want the application to run locally on my machine, so that I can use it without deployment or hosting costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the application THEN it SHALL run on localhost
2. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL not require internet connectivity for core functionality
3. WHEN I access the application THEN it SHALL work through a web browser on my local machine
4. WHEN I close the application THEN my data SHALL persist for the next session
5. WHEN I restart the application THEN it SHALL load my existing data automatically

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a sprint manager, I want the application built with modern JavaScript frameworks, so that it's maintainable and uses familiar technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL use either Next.js or Astro as the framework
2. WHEN I need to modify the application THEN it SHALL use standard JavaScript/TypeScript patterns
3. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL provide a responsive web interface
4. WHEN I build the application THEN it SHALL have minimal external dependencies
